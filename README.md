## Implementation Details

The integration uses Google Apps Script to create a webhook endpoint that receives lead data from Meta. When a new lead is submitted:

1. Meta sends the lead data to your Google Apps Script webhook
2. The script processes and formats the data
3. Data is automatically appended to your Google Sheet
4. A success/error response is sent back to Meta

## Data Structure

The script creates the following columns in your spreadsheet:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the lead was received by the script |
| Form ID | Meta Lead Form identifier |
| Lead ID | Unique lead identifier |
| Created Time | When the lead was created in Meta |
| Page ID | Facebook Page identifier |
| Ad Group ID | Associated ad group |
| Campaign ID | Associated campaign |
| Platform | Source platform |
| Form Data | JSON string containing all form fields |
